# NLP_Text_Summarization_Project

# Overview
I spend countless hours a week absorbing podcasts, and I am also passionate about exploring new NLP technique. In this project I am comparing two text sumamrization models while summarizing some top 2021 podcast descriptions. Hopefully I discover a new podcast to listen to along the way!

# Data
The podcast descriptions and photos used in this project were scraped from a goodhousekeeping article that can be found here:
